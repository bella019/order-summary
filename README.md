## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Media Query

### What I learned

```Css
.music-div {
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    display: flex;
    width: 320px;
    height: 80px;
    background-color:hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
    margin-left: 40px;
    margin-top: 10px;
}
Being able to effectively style this div in another div with correct style 

### Continued development
I would love to continue with the concept of using flexboxes and Css grid properities
